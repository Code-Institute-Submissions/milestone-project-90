## 1️⃣ Project Construction 👷
This project uses the Bootstrap Framework to create a multi-page, fully responsive website with a mobile-first approach. The project is fully compliant with the requirements set by Code Institute, it does not contain java-script or back-end functions.

Despite the above, the website contains two forms, although there is no confirmation of submitting the application and the information is sent to the Code Institute server for demonstration purposes.

As my skill level grows, the functionality of the website will evolve to include java script features, back-end features and online payments. Then it can be used for commercial purposes.
